# Dynamic-memory-allocation

Dynamic Memory Allocation is a process in which we allocate or deallocate a block of memory during the run-time of a program.

There are four functions malloc(), calloc(), realloc() and free() present in <stdlib.h> header file that are used for Dynamic Memory Allocation in our system. It can also be referred to as a procedure to use Heap Memory in which we can vary the size of a variable or Data Structure (such as an Array) during the lifetime of a program using the library functions.

Dynamic Memory Allocation is considered as a very important concept in the field of Data Structures and is used in almost every Data Structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Dynamic Arrays, Queue, etc.
